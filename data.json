It's a demo that Google Cloud Developer Advocates (Ray Tsang, Bret McGowen, and Francesc Campoy) developed for the Google Cloud Platform Next event series. The demo, consists of 19 Nexus 6 cameras that were placed around a half-circle pointing inwards to take a picture of the subject at the same moment in time, to create a 180 degree animated GIF - see them at @googlecloudspin twitter! But wait, the Android cameras introduces some unknown delays when taking a photo - how did we make all the cameras take pictures at the same time? What did we use to process and stitch the photos together? And most importantly, how did we pull it off in a matter of 3 weeks? Join this session to learn more about what we did behind the scenes, and how we leveraged open source technology, Google Cloud Platform, and Firebase to help us develop the demo rapidly.",

It's a demo that Google Cloud Developer Advocates (Ray Tsang, Bret McGowen, and Francesc Campoy) developed for the Google Cloud Platform Next event series. The demo, consists of 19 Nexus 6 cameras that were placed around a half-circle pointing inwards to take a picture of the subject at the same moment in time, to create a 180 degree animated GIF - see them at @googlecloudspin twitter! But wait, the Android cameras introduces some unknown delays when taking a photo - how did we make all the cameras take pictures at the same time? What did we use to process and stitch the photos together? And most importantly, how did we pull it off in a matter of 3 weeks? Join this session to learn more about what we did behind the scenes, and how we leveraged open source technology, Google Cloud Platform, and Firebase to help us develop the demo rapidly.",
