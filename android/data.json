Drawing from examples encountered with Pinterest’s own transition to Retrofit, we’ll explore ways to retrofit Retrofit onto an existing networking layer while balancing the interests of hundreds of millions of users relying on a performant app. Ranging from big wins to unsightly mistakes, this tour will be both a cringeworthy and infinitely practical look at what happens when you can’t start from scratch.

Effective and intentional mentoring decreases the number of bugs shipped to the Play Store, improves the quality of your application, and helps keep code standards high as your team grows and changes.\n\n\nYet for all of its importance, there is hardly any information about how to mentor effectively.  There are many resources about how engineers can get 4% productivity gains by learning new Android Studio shortcuts, but there are almost none about how they can get 400% productivity gains for their team by helping other developers be more productive.\n\n\nIn this talk, I'll discuss how to think about mentoring Android engineers from the ground-up.  First, we’ll discuss how to structure a plan for your mentee such that they move from “What’s an ADB?” to “Let’s use Retrofit, RxJava, and Dagger to make a testable app with MVP architecture” in no-time flat.  Next, we’ll talk about how to interact with your mentee such that every challenge helps them level-up their development skills and build your team culture.  Lastly, we’ll discuss how you can use your experience as a mentor to improve your own engineering skills.",

The goal of this session is to get you started developing great apps for this emerging platform.\n\n\nWe’ll talk about how to:\n- Extend your existing audio or messaging app to be compatible with an Android Auto head unit;\n\n- Use Android Auto to play music, compose and read messages and respond to user voice actions;\n\n- Develop and test your apps with the Desktop Head Unit;\n\n- Make sense of the Android Auto design guidelines and usability requirements that are in place for Auto apps;\n\n- Distribute your Auto app through Google Play.\n\n\nJoin us as we walk through real-life examples and see just how easy it is to get started with Android Auto!",

Effective and intentional mentoring decreases the number of bugs shipped to the Play Store, improves the quality of your application, and helps keep code standards high as your team grows and changes.\n\n\nYet for all of its importance, there is hardly any information about how to mentor effectively.  There are many resources about how engineers can get 4% productivity gains by learning new Android Studio shortcuts, but there are almost none about how they can get 400% productivity gains for their team by helping other developers be more productive.\n\n\nIn this talk, I'll discuss how to think about mentoring Android engineers from the ground-up.  First, we’ll discuss how to structure a plan for your mentee such that they move from “What’s an ADB?” to “Let’s use Retrofit, RxJava, and Dagger to make a testable app with MVP architecture” in no-time flat.  Next, we’ll talk about how to interact with your mentee such that every challenge helps them level-up their development skills and build your team culture.  Lastly, we’ll discuss how you can use your experience as a mentor to improve your own engineering skills.",

The result is a structure that allows Android applications to be modular, testable, and performant with minimal boilerplate and infrastructure.\n\nThis is an overview of what has been added, how it was designed and how to apply it.
