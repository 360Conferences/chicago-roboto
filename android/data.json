How do you get closer to making your code idiomatic?\n\nIn the third part of our series on learning the cool and idiomatic parts of Kotlin, we're going to look at some intermediate Kotlin topics. We're going to look at how inlining can improve the performance on higher-order functions as well as allow us to take advantage of type reification. Then we'll take a look at how delegation can help us write dryer, more efficient, and more interesting properties with less boiler plate. Finally, we'll dive into the magical world of asynchronous programming the Kotlin way with coroutines.",

      "abstract" : "Writing high-quality path morphing animations for Android is a near impossible task. In order to morph one shape into another, the SVG paths describing the two must be compatible with each other‚Äîthat is, they need to have the same number and type of drawing commands. Unfortunately popular design tools, such as Sketch and Illustrator, do not take this into account, and as a result engineers will often have to spend time tweaking the raw SVGs given to them by designers before they can be morphed. To address this issue, I built a web app called Shape Shifter (https://shapeshifter.design), a tool that helps developers and designers to more easily create path morphing animations for their Android apps. In this talk, I will explain how to use Shape Shifter to create seamless transitions between arbitrary shapes using AnimatedVectorDrawables. I will also explain how Shape Shifter internally uses bioinformatics algorithms in order to auto-generate morphing animations between incompatible shapes, as well as some of the challenges I faced while building the tool.",

In order to morph one shape into another, the SVG paths describing the two must be compatible with each other‚Äîthat is, they need to have the same number and type of drawing commands. Unfortunately popular design tools, such as Sketch and Illustrator, do not take this into account, and as a result engineers will often have to spend time tweaking the raw SVGs given to them by designers before they can be morphed. To address this issue, I built a web app called Shape Shifter (https://shapeshifter.design), a tool that helps developers and designers to more easily create path morphing animations for their Android apps. In this talk, I will explain how to use Shape Shifter to create seamless transitions between arbitrary shapes using AnimatedVectorDrawables.
